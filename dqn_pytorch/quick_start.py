üöÄ HOW TO RUN BOTH AGENTS AT THE SAME TIME
=============================================

There are 3 ways to run the dual agent comparison:

METHOD 1: Interactive Menu (Recommended)
---------------------------------------
python run_comparison.py

This will show you a menu and guide you through the process.


METHOD 2: Direct Command Line
-----------------------------
python dual_agent_comparison.py [config_name] --episodes [number]

Examples:
  python dual_agent_comparison.py flappybird_comparison --episodes 100
  python dual_agent_comparison.py cartpole_comparison --episodes 50


METHOD 3: Quick Test (CartPole - Fast)
--------------------------------------
python dual_agent_comparison.py cartpole_comparison --episodes 50

This runs a quick 2-3 minute test to see how it works.


WHAT YOU'LL SEE DURING TRAINING:
================================
üé≤ RISKY AGENT: Messages with dice emoji
   ‚Ä¢ Starts with 100% random actions (high exploration)
   ‚Ä¢ Slowly becomes less random (but stays risky)
   ‚Ä¢ Takes more chances, higher variance in performance

üõ°Ô∏è  SAFE AGENT: Messages with shield emoji  
   ‚Ä¢ Starts with 30% random actions (moderate exploration)
   ‚Ä¢ Quickly becomes very conservative (1% random)
   ‚Ä¢ Plays it safe, more consistent performance

üìä Progress updates every 60 seconds showing:
   ‚Ä¢ Episodes completed by each agent
   ‚Ä¢ Best rewards achieved
   ‚Ä¢ Current risk levels (exploration %)

üìà Real-time graph updates showing performance comparison


OUTPUT FILES:
=============
runs/[config]_risky.pt        - Risky agent's trained model
runs/[config]_safe.pt         - Safe agent's trained model
runs/[config]_risky.log       - Risky agent's training log
runs/[config]_safe.log        - Safe agent's training log
runs/[config]_comparison.png  - Performance comparison graph


STOP TRAINING:
==============
Press Ctrl+C at any time to stop both agents and see final results.
